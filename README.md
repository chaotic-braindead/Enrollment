<h3>Getting Started</h3>

**A. Dependencies**
The application requires dependencies in order to work properly. Ensure that the following are installed before proceeding to run the application:

- MySQL Server 8.2 (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) - At the time of this release, the database for the enrollment system relies on a locally-hosted database due to limited resources. Note: The mysql bin folder must added to the system environment variables.
- Java (https://www.java.com/en/)

**B. Download the application**

- The latest irregular enrollment system package can be downloaded through GitHub: https://github.com/chaotic-braindead/Enrollment/releases/

- Extract the EnrollmentSystem zip file.

**C. Load the database**

- Run the “init_db” batch file and enter your mysql credentials to initialize the database.
- Wait for the initialization to finish.

**D. Run the application**
