<h3>Getting Started</h3>

**A. Dependencies**
The application requires dependencies in order to work properly. Ensure that the following are installed before proceeding to the next steps:

- [MySQL Server 8.2](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) - At the time of this release, the enrollment system relies on a locally-hosted database due to limited resources. **Note: The mysql bin folder must be added to the system environment variables.**
- [Java SE Development Kit 21 or newer](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html)

**B. Download the application**

- The latest irregular enrollment system package can be downloaded through [GitHub](https://github.com/chaotic-braindead/Enrollment/releases/)

- Extract the **EnrollmentSystem.zip** file.

**C. Load the database**

- Open the folder named **db**
- Run the **init_db** batch file and enter your mysql credentials to initialize the database.
- Wait for the initialization to finish.

**D. Run the application**

- Run the application by clicking on the **EnrollmentSystem.jar** file.
- **If the application window exceeds your monitor's bounds, set your display scaling to 100% on your device's display settings.**
